webManAPI is an SDK used to interact with a PlayStation 3 over the network. It requires a jailbroken PlayStation 3 with webMAN MOD and is developed on the .net framework 4.5.2.

Features
========
* You can list your games
* Mount, unmount and then launch games/apps.
* You can Shutdown and Restart your console.

How to use this Library
=======================
There is an example project called "webManAPI Library Test" in the solution that tests the libraries functionality using Asynchronous Tasks.

Future Developments
===================
There are still some items that could be implemented into this library:
* Remote Control Pad.
* File Browser.
* Waking the PS3 Remotely from Stand By mode.

Am happy to accept pull requests for any bug fixes or feature requests.
